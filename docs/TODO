../README.md was based on this file, removed the preambly bits to that.

From the discussion on
http://www.doomworld.com/vb/source-ports/58608-make-a-gpl-fork-of-gzdoom the
following issues arise:

- Build code is problematic: software renderer is an issue in this regard.
- oplsynth code is a problem. Ironically, they've partially implemented the
  same dosbox opl code as chocolate doom.
- openAL is a problem, but we want to avoid it anyway.
- output_sdl will need a rewrite obviously.


Check docs/fmod-dep and docs/silverman-dep for problem files.
Reference kenbuild.zip and jfbuild_src20050531.zip for the actual Build
sourcecode. We probably need to carefully compare where this stuff is, its
mostly math routines and rendering.

track upstream master (https://github.com/coelckers/gzdoom) for merging, remove
other branches, we don't need them.
